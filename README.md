## Introduction

*The introduction connects all relevant points in a concise narrative. The problem description is unambiguous and the connection to the recommender system convincingly presented. It is clear how value-sensitive design in integrated in the project. No need for further clarifications is needed.*

Recommender systems aim to predict users' interests and recommend stuff that is interesting for the user. Data are required for recommender systems from either from the user (collaborative filtering), service provider (content-based filtering), or both (hybrid filtering). 

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is the national broadcaster of the United Kingdom. Headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, it is the world's oldest national broadcaster, and the largest broadcaster in the world by the number of employees, employing over 22,000 staff in total, of whom approximately 19,000 are in public-sector broadcasting. They produce programs and services for audiences throughout the UK. They also produce content that can be enjoyed across the globe.

There are many stakeholders from BBC started from their service provider, viewer/user/reader, Board of Executives, Commercial Provider, and a lot of stakeholders that need to be mentioned. In this project, the main stakeholders are The service provider and the viewer. The service provider in this case is the one who provides BBC the content of the news or informative videos. On the other hand, the viewer is the one who enjoys and watches the content that has been provided by BBC.



## Literature Reviews

*The literature review is an almost complete discussion of relevant concepts, issues, and existing knowledge that informs clear definitions that suit the context of the project.*



## Method

*The operationalization is logical and (virtually) complete. It will allow for a high level of accuracy of observations and measurements through the design of the recommender system.*



## Interface Design

*There is a comprehensive and transparent account for the different motivations behind concrete design choices. Different challenges are critically addressed and arguments for the chosen approach are not only convincing but close to optimal.*



## Conclusion

*The conclusion is concise, complete, critical, and proposes feasible steps for future research. The reader has few if any questions about the research process as it is presented in the report.*
